## About Scarab
Scarab is a visualization and debugging tool for machine learning models. 

### Heatmap

![Diff between checkpoint Heatmap](./screenshot/diff_heatmap.png)

Visualize the parameter changes between checkpoint models. When the model overfits to the training dataset, visualizing the parameter changes between epochs can help identify which weights contribute to regression.

### Profile and debug bad predictions

![Layer Activation Output](./screenshot/profile_activation_heatmap.png)

Visualize the layer activations with heatmaps to get a better understanding why predictions are wrong.

### View Test Dataset errors

![Test Dataset errors](./screenshot/epoch_test_img_report.png)
